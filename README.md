# My Style

[My Style](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-style/ljdhjpmbnkbengahefamnhmegbdifhlb)
is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to insert custom CSS into pages,
immediately see the visual results, and have that CSS persist for future
visits.

## Usage

Take TechCrunch, for example. You may dislike the site's design and want to add
your own touch--that is, your own style--to make it aesthetically pleasing.
After installing the extension, visit [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com) and
hit control + m in your browser. You should see a textarea to the right:

![Techcrunch textarea](https://raw.github.com/karthikv/my-style/master/screenshots/techcrunch-textarea.png)

Insert your custom CSS and see results:

![Techcrunch restyled](https://raw.github.com/karthikv/my-style/master/screenshots/techcrunch-restyled.png)

(Note: if you'd like this specific Techcrunch skin, it's available at
[styles/techcrunch.css](https://github.com/karthikv/my-style/blob/master/styles/techcrunch.css).)

This CSS will be reinserted upon revisiting Techcrunch, thereby saving your
styles. Pressing control + m once more will hide the textarea, but your
contents will still be retained.

To speed up the process of styling, if you hold alt while clicking an element,
a selector for that element will automatically be appended to the textarea
editor. With this, you can circumvent the time it takes to inspect the element
to find how to target it.

## Installation

You may install My Style at the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-style/ljdhjpmbnkbengahefamnhmegbdifhlb).
Just click the 'Add to Chrome' button.

## How it works

My Style is quite simple. It inserts a textarea into the page, looks for
changes to the textarea's contents, and updates a dynamically inserted style
tag appropriately. My Style employs local storage to make CSS changes
persistent. It uses simple technologies for a simple result.

## Improvements

Sites that clear local storage can erase My Style's custom CSS. A more
persistent form of storage (e.g. the JavaScript FileSystem APIs) would be
a better option to retain CSS.
